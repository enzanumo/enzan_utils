# enzan_utils
My utilities.

I'll do my best explaining why I wrote these and how they helped me.
However, big chances are, they can help nobody but myself.

Anyway, even the util may be one-time use, I will still pay attension to the Quality of Code.
Just like Steve Jobs said,
> "When you're a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you're not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You’ll know it's there, so you're going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through."
